Problem: 

Company links open in personal chrome profile causing frustrtation.

Solution: 

Use finicky which provides handlers and hooks before opening chrome links. 


1. Install with homebrew-cask: brew install --cask finicky
2. Create a file called .finicky.js with configuration (examples) in your home directory. Attched file in directory
3. Start Finicky. Please allow it to be set as the default browser.
4. And you're done. All links clicked that would have opened your browser are now first handled by Finicky.
